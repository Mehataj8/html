    <h3>History pf pollution:-</h3>
    <p>Pollution is not a new phenomenon. In fact, pollution has been a problem since the appearance of our earliest ancestors. Increasing human populations have opened the door to more bacteria and disease. During the Middle Ages, diseases such as cholera and typhoid fever broke out all across Europe.</p>
    <h3>Pollution control:-</h3>
    <p>The presence of environmental pollution raises the issue of pollution control. Great efforts are made to limit the release of harmful substances into the environment through air pollution control, wastewater treatment, solid-waste management, hazardous-waste management, and recycling. </p>
    <h3>Future Directions:-</h3>
    <p>Major strides have been made to improve air quality, but many complex scientific questions remain, calling for innovative and novel research.

        It has become increasingly clear that multiple pollutants play a role in determining risks to people and the environment. EPA is moving forward with a "multipollutant" approach to air pollution research. It is crucial to understand the collective impacts of multiple air pollutants, how they interact in the atmosphere and whether the interactions modify health effects. EPA's Air, Climate, and Energy Research has already spearheaded interdisciplinary efforts to study combinations of multiple pollutants more extensively.</p>
